# [54-5] Update markdown-tasks Provider with Current-PBI Hint

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Modify the `markdown-tasks.sh` built-in provider to emit a `current_pbi_id` field in its JSON output, identifying the PBI most likely being actively worked on based on backlog status.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|

## Requirements

1. After parsing all PBIs, detect the "current" PBI using this logic:
   - Find the first PBI with status `InProgress` (case-insensitive).
   - If no InProgress, find the first with status `Agreed`.
   - If neither, leave `current_pbi_id` unset.

2. Emit the hint in the top-level JSON output:
   ```json
   {
     "current_pbi_id": "PBI-54",
     "current_pbi_title": "Session-Scoped Current PBI Resolution for PM View",
     "groups": [...]
   }
   ```

3. Also mark the matching group with `"is_current": true` in the groups array.

4. If no current PBI is detected, omit `current_pbi_id` and `current_pbi_title` from the output (don't emit null/empty values).

5. Maintain backward compatibility — existing consumers that ignore unknown fields are unaffected.

## Implementation Plan

1. After the backlog parsing loop, scan `pbi_ids` for the first InProgress PBI (then Agreed as fallback).
2. Store the detected current PBI ID in a variable.
3. When building each group's JSON, add `is_current: true` if the group's PBI ID matches.
4. In the final JSON output, add `current_pbi_id` and `current_pbi_title` fields if a current PBI was detected.
5. Use `jq` to conditionally add fields.

## Test Plan

- Run the provider against the actual `docs/delivery/` directory and verify JSON output contains `current_pbi_id` when an InProgress PBI exists.
- Verify `is_current: true` appears on exactly one group.
- Verify output remains valid JSON parseable by `task.ParseProviderOutput`.
- Verify backward compatibility: output still has `groups` array with expected structure.
