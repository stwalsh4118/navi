# [16-1] Define GitInfo types and constants

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Define the data structures and constants needed for git integration. This includes the GitInfo struct that will hold branch name, dirty status, ahead/behind counts, last commit, and remote information. Also define display constants like icons and formatting.

## Requirements

- Define `GitInfo` struct with fields for:
  - `Branch` (string): Current branch name
  - `Dirty` (bool): Whether there are uncommitted changes
  - `Ahead` (int): Commits ahead of remote
  - `Behind` (int): Commits behind remote
  - `LastCommit` (string): Short hash + subject of last commit
  - `Remote` (string): Remote URL (for GitHub detection)
- Define constants for git display:
  - Dirty indicator character (e.g., "●")
  - Ahead/behind format strings
  - Git info separator
- Add JSON tags for serialization compatibility

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `git.go` file for git-related types and functions
2. Define `GitInfo` struct with appropriate JSON tags
3. Define display constants for git indicators
4. Add helper function to format git status line (branch + dirty + ahead/behind)

## Test Plan

- TypeScript/Go compilation passes without errors
- GitInfo struct can be marshaled/unmarshaled to JSON correctly
- Format helper produces expected output for various git states

## Verification

- [ ] GitInfo struct defined with all required fields
- [ ] JSON tags added for serialization
- [ ] Display constants defined
- [ ] Format helper function implemented
- [ ] Code compiles without errors

## Files Modified

- `git.go` - New file with GitInfo struct, GitHubInfo struct, constants, and format helpers
- `git_test.go` - New file with unit tests for GitInfo and formatting functions
