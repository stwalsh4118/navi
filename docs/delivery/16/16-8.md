# [16-8] Add G keybinding for git detail view

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Implement a modal git detail view that opens when user presses `G` on a session with git info. The view shows full branch information, remote details, and navigation options. Use similar patterns to the existing dialog system.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|

## Requirements

- `G` keybinding opens git detail view for selected session
- If session has no git info, show brief "Not a git repository" message
- Git detail view shows:
  - Branch name (full, not truncated)
  - Remote URL
  - Last commit (hash + full subject)
  - Dirty status (with file count if dirty)
  - Ahead/behind counts with context
  - PR/Issue link if detected
- `Esc` closes the view
- `Enter` or `o` opens PR link in browser (if available)
- `d` shows diff preview (next task)

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `GitDetailView` to DialogMode enum (or create separate view mode)
2. Add `G` keybinding in Update() when no dialog is open
3. Create `renderGitDetailView(session SessionInfo, width, height int) string`
4. Handle Esc to close view
5. Store selected session reference for git detail view
6. Update footer to show git detail keybindings when view is open

## Test Plan

- G key opens git detail view for session with git info
- G key shows message for non-git session
- Esc closes the view
- All git information displayed correctly
- View renders within terminal bounds

## Verification

- [ ] G keybinding implemented
- [ ] Git detail view renders correctly
- [ ] All git info displayed
- [ ] Esc closes view
- [ ] Footer shows appropriate keybindings
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Tests pass
