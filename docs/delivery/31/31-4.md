# [31-4] Apply vim-style search to task panel

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Port the vim-style exact-match search with `n`/`N` cycling, highlights, and match counter to the task panel, replacing the existing fuzzy task search.

## Requirements

- Task panel search (`/` when task panel has focus) uses exact case-insensitive substring matching against task title, task ID, and group title
- All tasks remain visible during search (no filtering/hiding)
- Matching tasks are highlighted; current match is distinctly highlighted
- `n`/`N` cycle through matching tasks in the task panel
- Match counter displayed in task search bar
- Search persists after `Enter`, clears on `Esc`
- Auto-expand groups that contain matching tasks (preserve existing behaviour)

## Implementation Plan

1. Add `taskSearchMatches []int` and `taskCurrentMatchIdx int` to the Model struct
2. Replace fuzzy matching in `getVisibleTaskItems()` with exact substring matching — but keep all items visible
3. Create `computeTaskSearchMatches()` to find matching task indices
4. Handle `n`/`N` in `updateTaskPanelFocus()` for cycling through task matches
5. Update task panel rendering to highlight matching tasks and show match counter
6. Ensure `Enter` persists search, `Esc` clears

## Test Plan

- Test exact matching against task title, ID, and group title
- Test `n`/`N` cycling in task panel
- Test all tasks remain visible during search
- Test groups auto-expand when containing matches
- Test search persistence and clearing

## Verification

- [ ] Task search uses exact substring matching
- [ ] All tasks visible during search
- [ ] Matching tasks highlighted with distinct current match
- [ ] `n`/`N` cycle through task matches
- [ ] Match counter displayed
- [ ] Groups auto-expand for matches
- [ ] Search persists after Enter, clears on Esc
- [ ] Tests pass
