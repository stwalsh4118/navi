# [31-5] Remove legacy fuzzy search code and update tests

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Remove all remaining fuzzy matching code (`fuzzyMatch`, `fuzzyFilter`, scoring logic) and update all existing search tests to validate exact-match behaviour instead.

## Requirements

- Remove `fuzzyMatch()` and `fuzzyFilter()` functions from `filter.go`
- Remove the `scored` struct and any relevance scoring logic
- Update `e2e_search_filter_test.go` tests to validate exact-match behaviour:
  - `TestFuzzyMatch` → replace with `TestExactMatch`
  - `TestE2E_AC2_SearchFiltersRealTime` → update expected results for exact matching
  - `TestE2E_SearchModeKeyRouting` → update for n/N navigation
  - `TestE2E_FilterComposition` → update filter composition expectations
- Update any other test files that reference fuzzy matching
- Ensure no dead code remains related to fuzzy search

## Implementation Plan

1. Delete `fuzzyMatch()`, `fuzzyFilter()`, and `scored` struct from `filter.go`
2. Rewrite `TestFuzzyMatch` as `TestExactMatch` testing exact substring behaviour
3. Update `TestE2E_AC2_SearchFiltersRealTime` — sessions no longer disappear from list during search
4. Update `TestE2E_SearchModeKeyRouting` to test `n`/`N` cycling
5. Update `TestE2E_FilterComposition` for new search-doesn't-filter behaviour
6. Add new tests for: match cycling, search persistence, wrap-around
7. Run full test suite to ensure nothing is broken

## Test Plan

- All updated tests pass with exact-match semantics
- No references to `fuzzyMatch` or `fuzzyFilter` remain in codebase
- `go vet ./...` clean
- Test coverage maintained on search functionality

## Verification

- [ ] `fuzzyMatch` and `fuzzyFilter` fully removed
- [ ] No dead code related to fuzzy scoring
- [ ] All tests updated and passing
- [ ] New test cases cover exact match, cycling, persistence
- [ ] `go vet` clean
- [ ] Tests pass with `-race`
