# [14-2] Render selection checkmarks in session list

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Update the session list rendering to visually indicate which sessions are selected. Selected sessions should show a checkmark (`✓`) alongside the existing cursor marker (`▸`), making the selection state immediately visible to the user.

## Requirements

- Selected sessions display a `✓` marker (or equivalent visual indicator)
- The cursor marker (`▸`) and selection marker (`✓`) must coexist (a session can be both cursored and selected)
- Unselected sessions show no checkmark
- The marker scheme must be visually clear and not conflict with existing indentation
- Selection markers must render correctly for both local and remote sessions
- Marker display must update immediately when selection changes

## Implementation Plan

1. Define new marker constants in `view.go`:
   - `selectedCheckmark` for selected sessions (e.g., `"✓ "`)
   - Update the marker rendering in `renderSession()` to combine cursor and selection indicators
2. Possible marker scheme:
   - `▸✓` = cursored + selected
   - `▸ ` = cursored + not selected
   - ` ✓` = not cursored + selected
   - `  ` = not cursored + not selected
3. Apply appropriate styling (e.g., green for checkmark)
4. Update `renderSession()` to check `m.selected[session.TmuxSession]`
5. Adjust `rowIndent` if needed to account for the additional marker width

## Test Plan

- Verify selected sessions show checkmark
- Verify unselected sessions do not show checkmark
- Verify cursor + selected session shows both markers
- Verify cursor + unselected session shows only cursor marker
- Verify rendering is consistent across session list

## Verification

- [ ] Checkmark displayed for selected sessions
- [ ] Cursor and selection markers coexist correctly
- [ ] Visual style is clear and consistent
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
- [ ] Tests pass
