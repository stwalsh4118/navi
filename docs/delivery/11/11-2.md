# [11-2] Define preview pane types and constants

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Define the types, constants, and configuration values needed for the preview pane feature. This includes layout modes, default dimensions, timing constants, and the preview state struct.

## Requirements

- Define `PreviewLayout` type for layout modes (side panel, bottom panel, inline expand)
- Define constants for preview dimensions (min/max width, default lines)
- Define timing constants (poll interval, debounce delay)
- Define `PreviewConfig` struct for configurable settings
- Keep constants together in a logical location (new preview.go file or in styles.go)

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `preview.go` file for preview-related types and constants
2. Define `PreviewLayout` type:
   ```go
   type PreviewLayout int
   const (
       PreviewLayoutSide PreviewLayout = iota
       PreviewLayoutBottom
       PreviewLayoutInline
   )
   ```
3. Define dimension constants:
   - `previewMinWidth` - Minimum width for preview pane
   - `previewDefaultWidth` - Default width (percentage or fixed)
   - `previewDefaultLines` - Default lines to capture (50)
   - `previewMinTerminalWidth` - Minimum terminal width to show preview
4. Define timing constants:
   - `previewPollInterval` - How often to refresh (1-2 seconds)
   - `previewDebounceDelay` - Delay after cursor change
5. Add appropriate documentation comments

## Test Plan

**Simple task - focus on compilation:**

- TypeScript/Go compilation passes without errors
- Constants are accessible from model.go

## Verification

- [ ] `preview.go` file created with types and constants
- [ ] All constants have meaningful names following Go conventions
- [ ] Types are properly documented
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Code quality checks pass
