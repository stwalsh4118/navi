# 41-4 E2E CoS Test

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

End-to-end verification that all PBI 41 acceptance criteria are met. Run the full test suite, verify agent indicator rendering, status aggregation, and detail area display work correctly together.

## Status History

| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2026-02-16 07:44:29 | Created | N/A | Proposed | Task file created | AI_Agent |

## Requirements

1. All 7 PBI 41 acceptance criteria verified
2. Full test suite passes (`go test -race ./...`)
3. `go vet ./...` clean
4. Integration scenarios covering multi-agent and single-agent sessions

## Implementation Plan

1. Run `go test -race ./...` and verify all tests pass
2. Run `go vet ./...` and verify clean output
3. Review test coverage for each acceptance criterion:
   - AC1: Sessions with OpenCode entry show `[OC ●/○]` indicator — covered by 41-2 tests
   - AC2: Sessions with no agents entries show no indicators — covered by 41-2 tests
   - AC3: Detail area shows per-agent status — covered by 41-3 tests
   - AC4: Sorting accounts for agent statuses — covered by 41-1 tests
   - AC5: Consistent styling — visual review of test output
   - AC6: All existing tests pass — `go test -race ./...`
   - AC7: New tests cover indicator rendering and aggregation — test count verification
4. Add any missing integration test scenarios discovered during review
5. Document results in Verification section

## Test Plan

### Objectives
Verify PBI 41 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied end-to-end.

### Key Scenarios
1. **Multi-agent session rendering**: Session with CC working + OC idle → row shows `[OC ○]`, detail shows both agents
2. **Single-agent session (no agents map)**: Row renders identically to pre-PBI-41 behavior
3. **Permission priority sorting**: Session with OC permission sorts above session with all agents idle
4. **Mixed team + agents**: Session with Team (PBI-33) and Agents (PBI-40) renders both badge and indicators
5. **Empty agents map**: `Agents: map[string]ExternalAgent{}` treated same as nil — no indicators

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass with `-race` flag
- `go vet` clean
- Each acceptance criterion has at least one test covering it
